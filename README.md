# MassReport-SCPSL
A script that mass reports a player, may be bannable idk may not work.


# HowToUse
Download AutoHotKey
Using the coordinates script while in game, run it and hover over the players report button and press F1 and F2
Then copy the coordinates into the first mousemove line

Then open it again and hover over the actual report button and copy the coordinates and paste it in the second line 
Once done. Run the script and if u want to change the binds (default e to open and f to close)



# Coordinates
Press F1 and F2



# Chance
There's not a high chance of this working to be able to get the player report unless you write a paragraph explaining why they are being unfair to you or other players.
this might be bannable.
